// This file exists to provide a single entry point for Sass consumers.
// It allows other packages (like enjanga-components-library) to do:
//   @use 'enjanga-core-setup/styles' as core;
// without Sass failing to resolve the path. It simply forwards everything
// from ./src/styles/index.scss.
//
// NOTE: Treat this file as the *public Sass API* for enjanga-core-setup.
// Internal file paths may change, but this entry point should remain stable.
@forward "./src/styles/index.scss";
